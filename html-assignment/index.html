   <p>  Hello!<br>
     My name is Irina and I am an international student from Russia.  <br>      
     I had a dream since I was ten years old - to study abroad. That’s why  <br>
     I am here now. The first goal is reached. But I won’t stop, it’s   <br>
     just the beginning. Now I have to improve my skills to reach next  <br>
     step of my life.</p>
     <p>Some about me. I like to draw, cook, read, learn something new and<br>
        look at people. I think this is the most interesting thing in the<br>
        world - people’s life. Everyone is the main character of their life.<br>
        Everyone has thoughts and opinions.  Usually, people inspire me to act.</p>
